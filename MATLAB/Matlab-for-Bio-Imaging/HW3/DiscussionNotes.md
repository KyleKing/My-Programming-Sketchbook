## Problem 1
1. Sound Pressure as attenuation occurs over length z:
p(z) = p(0)*exp(-mu*z)

2. Reflection at the interface:
p_r(z) = p(z)* |Z2 - Z1|/(Z2+Z1)

3. At detection:
p'(0) = p_r(z)exp(-mu*z)

4. DB attenuation
dB = 20 log10(p(0)/p'(0))

For a, step 2 is replaced by p_r(z) = p(z)

alpha is mu in units of dB
alpha = 20log10(mu)


## Problem 2


## Problem 3
Estimate part b - no need for weighted function
