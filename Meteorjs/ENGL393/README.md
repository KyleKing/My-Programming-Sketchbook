# ENGL393 Final Paper

I needed a way to include code snippets into my final paper for a professional writing class, so I created a meteor apllication that when viewed in a web browser could be printed to a pdf and submitted. Alongside the paper, I built a sample real time map application. It is pretty easy to replicate and a good way to start learning Meteor. So feel free to follow along and give me any feedback.
