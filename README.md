# My Programming Sketchbook

Everything that I work on that doesn't have its own repository. To see more info, check out the README for each individual, which will include more in-depth documentation for the included contents. This page only serves to highlight my most interesting or useful folders

## C

> Currently unorganized and not much to look at yet, but will contain Arduino and Microduiono ```.ino``` files and a couple of C functions

## Extensions

> Currently unorganized and not much to look at yet, but will contain my chrome extensions and Popclip extension(s)

*Chrome Extensions*

- [A Better WebClock UI - only shows the correct button - either "clock in" or "clock out"](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Chrome%20Extensions/A%20Better%20WebClock)
- [CrocoDoc FullScreen - opens view feedback button as full screen rather than as the tiny iframe](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Chrome%20Extensions/CrocDoc%20FullScreen)
- [Auto Literature Proxy - automatically redirects the user to the on-campus prozy that provides free access to journal articles](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Chrome%20Extensions/Auto%20Literature%20Proxy)

## iOS

> Currently empty, but will change soon

## JavaScript

> Node.js apps and some notes from Hackerank

- Reusable snippets
	- Non random
- Sample applications?
	- Express? -> based on Clock model?
- HackerRank testing thing + challenges

## MATLAB

> Currently unorganized, but there is a lot to go here (Bioimaging, DeVoe lab research, and more?)

## Meteor.js

> Probably the largest of all of these folder

> Once reogranized will include:

- Real Time Leaflet Maps
- Some sort of dashboard app?
- XBee parser
- Data collection -> maybe json/array to describe incoming and outgoing data structure?
- Real Time Data Collection
- Links to created packages (directory)
- And more...

## Other

> Currently Unorganized

## Python

> Small example scripts, but most of my python functions are in separate projects, like my [Alfred script](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/blob/master/Alfred/user.workflow.D67DE9BE-47D0-4727-BF34-DFA7132EDCD1/hammerspoon.py) or in the raspberry pi folder

## Raspberry Pi

> Currently Unorganized and possibly not working?

## Scripts

> My Hammerspoon configuration file, some bash scripts, and applescripts
