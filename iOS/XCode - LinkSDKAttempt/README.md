The Lap Timer project uses the Link SDK to control a timer while running. A single button press starts the timer and logs the current lap time, double press stops the lap timer, and long press resets the lap timer. This app also shows how users can reconfigure the button mappings from within the app.

Once you have downloaded an example project, make sure to download the most recent version of the Link SDK from the Misfit Developer Portal and add it to the project.
