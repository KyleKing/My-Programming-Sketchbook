Genes include protein and rRNA.
Regulatory sequences

See conserved sections of genome outside of gene - for project


## Review for Exam:


### 9
- Micro array tell regulation level of genes - mRNA
- same absolute value of up/down regulation
- More data sets = inferential statistics
- reduces data dimensionality to show relationships = Principal component analysis /= micro array
- self-organizing map = some structure in formation of clusters
- unsupervised = no initial assumptions / supervised = prior knowledge

### 10
- Domain can be anywhere in any protein
- motif < domain
- motif =/= homology
- very between species of gene by gene ontology consortium
- understand different components of GOC:
- ALl of the above to uncover gene function - bait/prey - isoelectric point - structural homologs
- 2D gel, duh!

### 11
- distant = more 3D, less 1D
- primary, secondary, etc
- NMR = good for small proteins
- PDB includes proteins, protein-DNA, and carbohydrates
- NCBI Vast = structure search against all near neighbors
- Cn3D - struc and seq viewer
- tertiary structure = CATH database
- homology = target - template, ab into = computer prediction
- Ab into is best if need quick answer

### 12
- Functional genomics = function to genome wide screen
- inhibit = observe phenotype = reverse (YKO - knockout yeast orf) - ONLY FINDS KNOWN GENES
- genetic foot printing + transposons = study any gene
- no barcode left by forward mutation
- a lot of reasons high though put has trouble - e all of the above
- protein networks are new and not much data yet
    + Hub protein are highly connected in protein network
- orhtologs are hard to identity for large scale pathway maps
