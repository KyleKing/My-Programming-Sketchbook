This directory contains the stable libraries that are shipped with the
Maple IDE.

DO NOT DEVELOP LIBRARIES HERE!  DO IT IN A LIBMAPLE BRANCH, THEN COPY
THE FINAL VERSION AT IDE RELEASE TIME.

In the past, we did our library development in the IDE repo.  However,
that blocks people who don't use the IDE from convenient access to the
extra libraries.

To resolve this issue, all library development now takes place on
libmaple branches.  Final versions are added to this repository as IDE
releases happen.
