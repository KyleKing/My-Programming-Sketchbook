CC3000 Multicast DNS 
Version 1.0
Copyright (c) 2013 Tony DiCola (tony@tonydicola.com)

This is a simple implementation of multicast DNS query support for an Arduino
and CC3000 WiFI chip.  Only support for resolving address queries is currently
implemented.

Requirements:
- Adafruit CC3000 Library: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CC3000_Library

Usage:
- Include the CC3000 Multicast DNS library in the sketch.
- Create an instance of the MDNSResponder class.
- Call the begin method in the sketch's setup and provide a domain name (without
  the '.local' suffix, i.e. just provide 'foo' to resolve 'foo.local'), and the 
  Adafruit CC3000 class instance.  Optionally provide a time to live (in seconds) 
  for the DNS record--the default is 1 hour.
- Call the update method in each iteration of the sketch's loop function.
