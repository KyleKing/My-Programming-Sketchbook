<p align="center">
  <img width="550" height=auto src="imgs/mushroom_and_sausage.jpg" alt="mushroom_and_sausage">
</p>

- 3 Links Italian Sausage
- 1 Small Onion
- 8 oz. Container of Button Mushrooms
- 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp basil
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1 lb box of Penne / rigatoni
- 1/4 cup Parmesan
- Chopped parsley (optional)

1. Dice the onion, wash and slice the mushrooms, and gather the other ingredients.
2. In a large pot, cook the sausages in a small amount of olive oil on medium heat until brown on the outside and firm (if precooked just skip this step) . Remove with tongs and slice into rounds - return to the pot to brown for a few minutes
3. Once the sausage rounds are browned, add the canned tomatoes, onion, garlic powder, mushrooms, basil, and oregano - stir!
4. Add about 3.5 cups of water and the box of pasta. Place a lid on and bring the pot to a rapid boil
5. As soon as it reaches a full boil, stir, replace the lid, then turn the heat down to low to simmer (~25% - 35%). Stir every five minutes and if at 15 minutes there is too much liquid, take off the lid and let simmer for slightly longer. Once ready, add the Parmesan and top with chopped parsley, if desired.
