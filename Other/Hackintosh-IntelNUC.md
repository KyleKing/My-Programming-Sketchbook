# [Guide for installing El Capitan on the Intel Broadwell NUC 5i3MYHE](http://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-el-capitan-on-the-intel-broadwell-nuc.171942/)

The previously install guide was deleted, so it is only fitting that the installation failed and that I will need to restart it.


## Configuration on my macbook

Downloaded OS X El Capitan, ran Unibeast to create a bootable drive, then installed the necessary files onto the USB drive.

Notes:

- The BIOS update is the '.zip' file (I used 0030) and see the BIOS settings selected in the sample images
- Unibeast takes awhile and had to restart a second time


## Booting

- Plugged in flash drive, restarted computer and then booted in verbose (select the USB EFI drive and then press space bar and arrow key down to the appropriate verbose option)
- Clicked on utility->disk utility dropdown menu and erased the old SSD
- Then began installing MAC OSX, but chose to install from a backup instead of a clean install. It might work?


# Time Machine

- So far has taken at least an hour to "Looking for applications and documents to transfer..."
	- Prepare to sit around for awhile: "Doing a migration via wi-fi could take a week or more"
	- Took about four-five hours? Suddenly finished when returned at 2 pm after starting at 10 am

# Post Install

- No NVME
- hit shake until got a one number week of manufacture (3), then combined that with the batch of CDY to use the serial number from the Macbook Air 6,2 (2013)
- Then added ASDF1 to complete the list of numbers needed for the MLB number. Weirdly, calculate wouldn't update the fields?
