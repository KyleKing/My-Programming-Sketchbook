# Bulk File RegExp Parser

Currently: Takes in poorly parsed COMSOl Data and outputs a parsed CSV dataset. Additionally removes comments, while maintaining original filename
Future: Simply edit the regular expressions in the runRegexp() function and quickly apply regular expressions to any batch of files present

- DirectoryName_Raw - Raw Files to Be Parsed
- DirectoryName_Parsed - CSV Parsed Output files

*init.js - the best file every written*
