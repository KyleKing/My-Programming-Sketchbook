# ENGL393 Final Paper

I needed a way to include code snippets into my final paper for a professional writing class, so I created a meteor apllication that when viewed in a web browser could be printed to a pdf and submitted. Follow along and run this meteor application on your computer, or checkout the pdf version in the `ENGL393` directory.
