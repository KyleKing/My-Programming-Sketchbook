My Programming Notebook
=========================
> [Inspired by this article](http://prog21.dadgum.com/202.html)

I've always been a doodler, so after some inspiration, I want to spend more time "doodling" with code. Anythin I post on codepen, write for Matlab, or my omputer in AppleScript and Lua will be posted here. Stay tuned!

## Contents
> The most interesting folder is my chrome extensino projects, everything else is more of personal notes:

- [A Better WebClock UI - only shows the correct button - either "clock in" or "clock out"](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Chrome%20Extensions/A%20Better%20WebClock)
- [CrocoDoc FullScreen - opens view feedback button as full screen rather than as the tiny iframe](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Chrome%20Extensions/CrocDoc%20FullScreen)
- [Auto Literature Proxy - automatically redirects the user to the on-campus prozy that provides free access to journal articles](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Chrome%20Extensions/Auto%20Literature%20Proxy)
