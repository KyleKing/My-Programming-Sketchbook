# My Programming Sketchbook

My folder of everything that didn't need its own repository. Each folder is organized by language. For example, the JavaScript folder has a useful bulk regular expression Node.js application that takes all files in one folder and outputs a transformed batch of files into a new folder. In the Alfred folder there is a work in progress Alfred workflow that allows for easy creation of shortcuts from toggling internet sharing to controlling connected hardware.

Explore the subfolders and open an issue if you have any questions or would like to see better documentation
