Prepare Quinoa and in parallel possibly prepare sautéed peppers and onions. When the quinoa is nearly ready, microwave a can each of black beans, tomatoes, and corn in a large tupper ware. Mix everything together with your choice(s) of red pepper flakes, curry powder, Sriracha, salsa, avocado, lettuce, etc. The quinoa can also be replaced with jasmine or other rice

2. In a large pot, cook the sausages in a small amount of olive oil on medium heat until brown on the outside and firm (if precooked just skip this step) . Remove with tongs and slice into rounds - return to the pot to brown for a few minutes
3. Once the sausage rounds are browned, add the canned tomatoes, onion, garlic powder, mushrooms, basil, and oregano - stir!
4. Add about 3.5 cups of water and the box of pasta. Place a lid on and bring the pot to a rapid boil
5. As soon as it reaches a full boil, stir, replace the lid, then turn the heat down to low to simmer (~25% - 35%). Stir every five minutes and if at 15 minutes there is too much liquid, take off the lid and let simmer for slightly longer. Once ready, add the Parmesan and top with chopped parsley, if desired.
