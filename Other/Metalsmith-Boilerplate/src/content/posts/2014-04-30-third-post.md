Notice how the filename for the post doesn't matter. It just helps to keep it consistent to easily find and edit.

Append #disqus_thread to the href attribute in your links. This will tell Disqus which links to look up and return the comment count. For example: <a href="http://foo.com/bar.html#disqus_thread">Link</a>
