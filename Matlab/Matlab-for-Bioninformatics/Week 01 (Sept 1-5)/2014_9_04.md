## Class notes - Tuesday

DNA practical details
* Sequences are conventionally written in a 5’ -> 3’ orientation
* ssDNA: DNA can exist as a single strand molecule
  * PCR primers
* dsDNA: double stranded DNA is more common in the Chromosome
* Sense strand: sequence same as mRNA
 * Anti-sense
* +/- strands
 * Convenient way to refer to the two strands

### Additionally, see 2014_9_04.pdf for drawings and additional notes

## Class notes - Thursday

- From last class there was a typo "amino acids" instead of bases
- GC content is a good way to test to see if sequence really is random
- See NCBI db mind map below
    - EST are overlapped into UniGene cluster (single seq)
- NCBI Operators
    - txid128952 (for taxonomy id) - used to reference non redundant database
    - AND OR NOT etc.
- Homework:
    - Read Chapter 1
    - Generate set GC content in rand seq generator
    - something else
