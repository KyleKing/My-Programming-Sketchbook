# Socket.io Controller

Built for Eric to operate a microfluidic device remotely and provide a demonstrative user interface.

To run, use `npm install` and `node index.js`. The app will be laoded at the `network-ip-address:8080` which will be printed at the time of start of the program. To actually make the program be useful, replace the necessary python code in both `device_operation.py' and 'capture.py'.
