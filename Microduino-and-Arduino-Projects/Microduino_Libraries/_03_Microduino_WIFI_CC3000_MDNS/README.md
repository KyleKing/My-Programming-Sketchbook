CC3000 Multicast DNS
====================

Version 1.0

This is a simple implementation of multicast DNS query support for an Arduino
and CC3000 WiFI chip.  Only support for resolving address queries is currently
implemented.

Requirements
------------
- [Adafruit CC3000 Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CC3000_Library)
- MDNS support in your operating system/client machines:
  - For Mac OSX support is built in through Bonjour already.
  - For Linux, install [Avahi](http://avahi.org/).
  - For Windows, install [Bonjour](http://www.apple.com/support/bonjour/).

Usage
-----
1. Download this repository as a zip (button on the right) and follow [these instructions to install into Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries).
2. Include the CC3000 Multicast DNS library in the sketch.
3. Create an instance of the MDNSResponder class.
4. Call the begin method in the sketch's setup and provide a domain name (without
   the '.local' suffix, i.e. just provide 'foo' to resolve 'foo.local'), and the 
   Adafruit CC3000 class instance.  Optionally provide a time to live (in seconds) 
   for the DNS record--the default is 1 hour.
5. Call the update method in each iteration of the sketch's loop function.

See the included MDNS echo server example for a full example (make sure you have the latest
version of Adafruit's CC3000 library with server support).
