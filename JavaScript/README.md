# Node and JS Apps

__Node-Bulk File RegExp__ - The most useful application, a reusable bulk modifier to apply a set of regexp rules. Currently modified to turn a COMSOL file into a CSV file and accounts for the indeterminate number of spaces between values

__Subprocess__ - Testing starting and stopping subprocesses in Javascript

*Hackerrank* - random snippets of code challenges that could be useful elsewhere

*Github-CheckRepoForUpdate* - Example using the GIthub API and later used for the N1-Unsubscribe plugin


## Random Notes:

Short Circuit Constructors: `var data = data || {};` or `var data = data ? data : {};`
