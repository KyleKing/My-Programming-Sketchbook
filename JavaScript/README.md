_*Node-Bulk File RegExp*_ - The most useful application, a reusable bulk modifier to apply a set of regexp rules. Currently modified to turn a COMSOL file into a CSV file and accounts for the indeterminate number of spaces between values

_*Subprocess*_ - Testing starting and stopping subprocesses in Javascript

*Hackerrank* - random snippets of code challenges that could be useful elsewhere

*Github-CheckRepoForUpdate* - Example using the GIthub API and later used for the N1-Unsubscribe plugin
