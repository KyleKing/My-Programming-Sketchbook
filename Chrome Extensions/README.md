# My Chrome Extensions

There are three extensions:

1. [`A Better Web Clock`](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Extensions/aaa/Chrome%20Extensions/A%20Better%20WebClock) - publicly available ([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-clock-ux/bemigfbpfihgefbnbncjddfbgknchfaf))
  I wanted to improve the WebClock interface as I would often mistake clocking in/out.
2. [`ELMS and CrocoDoc FullScreen`](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Extensions/aaa/Chrome%20Extensions/CrocDoc%20FullScreen) - publicly available ([link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elms-and-crocodoc-fullscr/plmlhafmgopajgbdobknemohlcnohbgb?utm_source=gmail))
  Canvas has a great set of tools for editing, but everything is trapped in a tiny view. This extension just directly opens the feedback in the same window, full screen! I built this to improve my experience while taking an English course.
3. [`Auto Literature Proxy`](https://github.com/KyleKing/My-Programming-Sketchbook/tree/master/Extensions/aaa/Chrome%20Extensions/Auto%20Literature%20Proxy) - still in development
  When off-campus, redirect to the UMD proxy for free journal access.

Try the extensions out and please give me feedback!
